The Water Tank Management System is a simple Java project that lets users add or remove water from a tank with a maximum capacity of 200 or 2,000 litters. 
It uses JOptionPane for an easy-to-use interface and shows the current water level after every action. The program also prevents the tank from overflowing 
or running empty by checking the userâ€™s input. It is a basic project that demonstrates abstraction and GUI interaction in Java.
